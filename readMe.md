# Code Jam: DataDive
#### By Karine Mellata, Christos Panaritis, Sadhvi Mehta and Alexander Torabi

The idea behind the project was to be able to link BitCoin price changes to news articles. Having scrapped google news and New York Times and other news outlets for headlines (as well as there publication date) related and not related to bitcoin. Using the dataset, it was possible to link the rise or decrease in stocks with the important keywords used in headlines. Using TD-IDF, we used a Neural Network to further predict the rise or decrease in a stock only based on keywords! <br/>

This program takes in as input a headline (typed by the user) and classifies the input in one of 5 categories : <br/>
- High decrease
- Low decrease
- Stability
- Low increase
- High increase


Application: Having an approximated change in price could be used to help people invest in BitCoin by minimizing losses as well as maximizing profits.
